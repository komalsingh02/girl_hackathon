# Circuit Evaluation and Fault Simulation

This Python script is used to evaluate a circuit and simulate faults in the circuit. It reads input from a circuit file and a fault file, performs circuit evaluation with correct and faulty inputs, and outputs the results to an output file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Place the `circuit.txt` and `fault.txt` files in the same directory as the Python script.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
5. Run the script using the following command:

   bash
   python circuit_evaluation.py
   

6. After the script finishes running, an output file named `output.txt` will be generated in the current directory.

## File Formats

### Circuit File

The circuit file (`circuit.txt`) should contain the net names and their corresponding expressions in the following format:


NET_NAME = EXPRESSION


Example:


A = B & C
B = ~D
Z = A ^ B


### Fault File

The fault file (`fault.txt`) should contain the fault location and the fault type in the following format:


FAULT_AT = FAULT_LOCATION
FAULT_TYPE = FAULT_TYPE_VALUE


Example:


FAULT_AT = A
FAULT_TYPE = 0


## Output

The script generates an output file called `output.txt`, which contains the input combinations, correct outputs, and faulty outputs for each test case. Each line in the output file follows the format:


[A, B, C, D] = [INPUT_VALUES], 'Z' = FAULTY_OUTPUT


Example:


[A, B, C, D] = [0, 1, 0, 1], 'Z' = 0
[A, B, C, D] = [1, 1, 0, 0], 'Z' = 1


---

Please ensure that the `circuit.txt` and `fault.txt` files are correctly formatted and contain the necessary information for the circuit evaluation and fault simulation.

Feel free to customize this README file based on your specific needs and add any additional information or instructions as necessary.
